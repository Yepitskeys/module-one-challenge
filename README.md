Module One Challenge for Week One

The goal of this challenge was to take the existing code and refactor it, so that the existing code followed the standards provided in the README.

With this in mind, I cleaned up the CSS by getting rid of unnecessary repeating code and condensing it into a cleaner/smaller section. I then took a look at the HTML where I added semantic tags (vs the exisiting div tabs), added a title to the page, as well as alt tags for the pictures.
